                                                      1 Introduction

                                                          Agentic AI systems—capable of iterative planning, autonomous task decomposition,
                                                      and continuous learning—are rapidly reshaping the landscape of human-computer
                                                      interaction (HCI). Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced
                                                      conversational agents have revitalized the ﬁeld of multi-agent systems, whose roots in
                                                      Artiﬁcial Intelligence predate the current rise of generative AI. Historically, multi-agent
                                                      systems have relied on agents with relatively limited capabilities; however, the emergence
                                                      of powerful, conversational LLMs greatly expands the range of possible multi-agent
                                                      interactions. In this new paradigm, humans themselves can participate as full-ﬂedged
                                                      agents, thanks to their innate conversational and decision-making abilities. The result is
                                                      a complex, interconnected ecosystem (Hopf et al., 2024).

    Borghoﬀ et al.    10.3389/fhumd.2025.1579166

    Simultaneously, novel       and more direct forms    of      human-
AI  integration are       emerging  (Pareschi, 2024; Saghaﬁan       and
Idan, 2024), in which advanced AI cognition is harnessed to
create “Centaurian” intelligence—a seamless fusion of human and
machine-driven capabilities.
                  These developments push beyond traditional HCI in two
distinct directions that mirror fundamental patterns found in
biological systems (Borghoﬀ et al., 1995;         von Bertalanﬀy, 1968;
Miller, 1978). Multi-agent systems, like biological ecosystems,
emphasize how collections of autonomous entities can coordinate
eﬀectively while preserving     distinct boundaries      and roles.  In
contrast,  “Centaurian”        systems pursue  deeper      integration—
analogous to the symbiotic relationships in nature—fusing human
and artiﬁcial   competencies    in     tightly  knit partnerships  that
often blur the lines between human decision making and AI-
driven processes. Living systems theory (Maturana and Varela,
1980) helps us understand how both approaches must address
a core challenge: maintaining system identity through regulated
boundaries and feedback loops (Wiener, 1948), whether in loosely
coupled collectives or tightly integrated hybrid intelligences.
            From an ethical and regulatory perspective, the blurring of
boundaries between human and artiﬁcial agents raises critical
issues of accountability and transparency.            As hybrid systems
increasingly share decision-making authority between human and
AI components, especially in domains such as healthcare, defense,
or ﬁnance, it becomes essential to ensure traceable paths of
action and deﬁne clear loci of control. By preserving observable
communication layers and explicit transitions, our architectural
model supports auditability and human oversight even in deeply
integrated Centaurian conﬁgurations. While our goal is primarily
analytical rather than normative, we recognize that formal clarity
in modeling is a prerequisite for ethical deployment.
             Herbert Simon’s inﬂuential work on cognitive architectures
(Simon, 1996) provides additional insight into how such human-AI
integration might be structured. His tripartite model—comprising
an  external interface,   a    coding  mechanism,    and an    internal
processing system—was originally conceived to explain human
problem-solving but extends naturally to hybrid systems. When
human abilities merge with artiﬁcial intelligence, the resulting
conﬁguration can evolve from traditional tool use (Homo Faber)
to a more profound integration (Centaurus Faber) where each
component may be instantiated by either human cognition or AI
subsystems (Pareschi, 2024). This perspective suggests how system
boundaries might be organized to support both autonomous
operation and deep integration.
            The framework proposed in this paper serves a dual purpose:
ﬁrst, as a             design methodology for structuring hybrid human-
AI systems, and second, as an analytical lens for understanding
their coordination dynamics. While not prescriptive in a regulatory
sense, it oﬀers a normative foundation for evaluating the degree and
quality of integration between agents. Its modular structure also
allows it to be adapted for formal veriﬁcation and implementation
in real-world systems.
       To address these architectural challenges, we introduce a formal
framework based on Petri nets (Petri, 1962; Murata, 1989) that
can model both multi-agent and Centaurian paradigms while
supporting the key requirements suggested by living systems theory
and Simon’s architecture: clear boundaries, regulated interactions,
and adaptive feedback loops. Unlike graph-based agent frameworks
(Wooldridge, 2002;        Weiss, 2013), which prioritize topological
relationships but struggle with dynamic concurrency, Petri nets
oﬀer native support for parallel processes and state transitions via
token semantics, critical for hybrid human-AI systems. Colored
Petri nets   (Jensen, 1995),  in   particular, allow us to encode
heterogeneous data,   agent   roles,  and interaction     semantics—
key to modeling learning, adaptation, and reasoning in hybrid
agent conﬁgurations.
     Our  approach,   grounded    in  rigorous process     modeling,
provides a uniﬁed way to specify how heterogeneous agents—
human and artiﬁcial—can coordinate their activities while either
maintaining autonomy or achieving deeper integration as needed.
     The  remainder   of  this    paper  is  organized  as  follows.
Section 2 analyzes two fundamental paradigms in human-machine
collaboration—the multi-agent approach and the Centaurian one—
in light of the recent resurgence of agentic AI. Section 3 provides
foundational background      on Petri   nets   and their extensions.
Section 4 introduces the concept of communication spaces as
a unifying framework for these paradigms, grounded in formal
architectures and coordination mechanisms. Sections 5 and 6
illustrate these ideas with two use cases, demonstrating how
communication spaces can be applied in practical HCI scenarios.
Section 7 discusses related work, and Section 8 concludes with
implications and future directions.


2 Paradigms in human-AI integration

     Agentic AI systems have reinvigorated two distinct approaches
to   human-AI collaboration:       multi-agent  architectures     and
Centaurian integration. This section examines these paradigms in
detail, highlighting the distinct challenges each presents for system
design and coordination.
     Indeed, although both paradigms involve interactions between
intelligent  entities,  they  represent   fundamentally     diﬀerent
approaches   to human-artiﬁcial    collaboration   (Pareschi, 2024).
Multi-agent  systems      maintain    distinct  boundaries  between
components   while      enabling complex     interactions, much like
natural   ecosystems.   In contrast,  Centaurian     systems  mirror
the   tight  integration   seen   in  biological  organisms,   where
components   merge      functionally  to  create   new  capabilities
(Saghaﬁan and Idan, 2024).



2.1 Architectural diﬀerences

     The primary architectural distinction lies in how these systems
organize and maintain their identity (Pareschi, 2024).
     Multi-agent   systems       (MAS)       emphasize    functional
independence,     where   agents—human       or artiﬁcial—operate as
distinct entities with decision-making capabilities and dynamic
collaboration. This design has allowed MAS implementations
to thrive even with relatively simple AI agents, focusing on
coordination rather than deep integration.
            Centaurian systems, by contrast, create uniﬁed composite
entities  where   human       and  artiﬁcial    components    become
functionally interdependent.     Theoretical    foundations for  such
systems trace back to Licklider (1960) and Engelbart (1962), but

    Borghoﬀ et al.    10.3389/fhumd.2025.1579166

    their practical feasibility has emerged only recently with generative               loose coupling of MAS and the tight integration of Centaurian
    AI systems capable of complementing human cognitive functions.                      systems while preserving their core attributes.
          A key concept in both systems is that of               communication
    spaces—regions of interaction where information exchange and
    coordination occur. In biological systems, these are signaling                      2.4 Situating human-machine
    pathways or neural networks; in human-machine systems, they                         collaboration in the context of agentic AI
    manifest   as protocols,    interfaces, and shared        representational
    spaces     (Bradshaw  et    al.,  2011). These spaces   enable      “joint              Advances in agentic AI heighten the relevance of multi-agent

2.2 Integration paradigms, operational
dynamics, and convergence points


      Each paradigm       embodies diﬀerent    principles from  living
systems    theory:    In  MAS,    collaboration occurs  through      well-
deﬁned protocols between autonomous agents, resembling distinct
organisms in an ecosystem. Eﬀectiveness emerges from collective
behavior while maintaining individual identities. In            Centaurian
systems, integration blurs the boundaries between human and
artiﬁcial components, forming functionally uniﬁed entities similar
to biological organisms.
      The  ecosystem      versus   organism     analogy   extends       to
operational dynamics:

    •         Identity maintenance: MAS preserve distinct agent identities
       while allowing interaction while, Centaurian systems         create
       new composite identities through integration.
    •               Adaptation mechanisms: MAS adapt via reconﬁguration of
              agent relationships, while Centaurian systems evolve through
       internal transformation of integrated components.
    •  System boundaries:               MAS maintain clear boundaries with
       well-deﬁned interfaces, while     Centaurian systems        develop
       permeable boundaries for deep functional integration.

            Despite these distinctions, some scenarios blur the boundaries
between    paradigms,     especially in  adaptive complex         systems.
Consider large action models (LAMs), where human operators
provide training feedback to artiﬁcial systems. Depending on
the    context, these     interactions   can manifest   as     multi-agent
collaboration or Centaurian integration. Such convergence points
suggest that while the paradigms are conceptually distinct, they can
complement each other in practice.


2.3 Implications for system design

      Viewing these paradigms through the lens of living systems
theory     has  key   design   implications: The  MAS design         focus
is    on   preserving agent       autonomy,  developing  protocols     for
eﬀective coordination, and ensuring system resilience through
independent agents. Centaurian systems, on the other hand, have
a design focus on emphasizing functional integration mechanisms,
developing     shared    representational    spaces, and   encouraging
emergent capabilities.
               Section 4 will introduce communication spaces as a unifying
framework supporting both paradigms, thus enabling both the
solve complex, multi-step problems autonomously. These systems
follow  a   four-step cycle  of perception, reasoning, action,     and
learning, continuously improving over time.
    Our     framework  provides  a theoretical  foundation         for
integrating agentic   AI into   human-machine   collaboration. It
is intended to be used primarily for system design, analytical
modeling, and normative assessment. The multi-agent paradigm
aligns with contexts where agentic AI must maintain autonomy
while coordinating with human and artiﬁcial agents via deﬁned
protocols—such as in distributed customer service or collaborative
software development.
    Conversely, the Centaurian paradigm is critical for cases that
require deep integration with human operators, such as healthcare
or  video   analytics, where AI seamlessly  blends     with human
expertise and decision making. The tight coupling characteristic
of Centaurian systems enables ﬂuid interactions for complex tasks
that require human judgment alongside AI-driven analysis.
    As agentic AI systems grow more sophisticated, the interplay
between these paradigms becomes more dynamic. For instance,
an enterprise AI system might operate independently (multi-agent
mode) for routine tasks while tightly integrating with human
experts (Centaurian mode) for complex decisions. Our framework
supports the understanding and design of such interactions.
       Additionally, the “data ﬂywheel” eﬀect—continuous learning
and adaptation—aligns with our model’s emphasis on system
evolution.  Learning   occurs   both in     the  improvement   of
independent agents (multi-agent paradigm) and in the reﬁnement
of  human-AI integration        patterns  (Centaurian  paradigm),
demonstrating how our framework accommodates various aspects
of agentic AI development.


3 Technical background: Petri nets

        To provide a rigorous foundation for modeling the complex
interactions in both multi-agent and Centaurian systems, we
employ Petri nets as our core formal framework. Petri nets
present   several advantages    for our     purpose: they   oﬀer a
clear graphical representation while maintaining mathematical
precision,  they  naturally  capture concurrent      processes     and
synchronization requirements, and they can be extended to handle
sophisticated data types and conditions through their colored
variants. These properties make them especially well-suited for
modeling interactions among heterogeneous agents, whether in
loosely coupled multi-agent conﬁgurations or tightly integrated
Centaurian systems. This section introduces the key concepts of
Petri nets and their extensions, which will serve as the formal basis
for our communication spaces framework.

    Borghoﬀ et al.    10.3389/fhumd.2025.1579166

    Petri nets are a well-established formalism for describing and
    analyzing the ﬂow of information and control in concurrent
    systems. Originally introduced by Petri (1962), they have evolved
    into a family of models widely applied in computer science, systems
    engineering, and workﬂow management. A Petri net consists of
    places, transitions, and arcs connecting places to transitions (or
    vice versa), with the system’s state captured by tokens that reside    P1      T1    P2
    in places. As transitions ﬁre, tokens move among places, thus          FIGURE 1

    (Murata, 1989).

3.1 Basic concepts and advantages


   •  Graphical clarity: One of the key strengths of Petri nets
      is their visual nature. Processes, resource constraints, and
      synchronization points are represented in a diagram, oﬀering
      an intuitive view of concurrent interactions. This makes Petri
      nets well-suited for communicating system designs to both
      technical and non-technical stakeholders.
   •  Explicit  concurrency:  Petri  nets        explicitly   capture
      concurrency  by       allowing  multiple  transitions   to          ﬁre
      independently if they have suﬃcient tokens in their input
      places. This feature provides a natural way to represent
      multi-agent or multi-component systems where actions may
      proceed in parallel.
   •  Formal analysis tools: A rich ecosystem of analysis techniques
      (e.g., reachability, liveness, boundedness) and software tools
      (e.g., colored Petri nets Tools¹) exists for verifying properties
      of Petri net models (Jensen, 1995). This is particularly useful
      for systems requiring rigorous guarantees, such as safety-
      critical applications or complex human-AI workﬂows.
   •  Modularity and extensibility: Petri nets provide a modular
      framework that can be extended to various specialized forms
      (e.g., timed, stochastic, colored), allowing the designer to
      incorporate  speciﬁc  features  such as      timing    constraints,
      probabilistic behavior, or typed tokens.


3.2 Colored Petri nets and typed tokens

     While  classical       Petri nets use indistinguishable  tokens       to
mark places,    colored             Petri nets extend this model by assigning
types or colors                to tokens. Places become typed containers, and
transitions can incorporate guard functions that enable more
complex behaviors (Jensen, 1995). This extension allows designers
to   encode complex         data  structures and  interaction       protocols
directly in the net, signiﬁcantly increasing expressiveness. In the
context of hybrid agent systems, colored Petri nets are especially
advantageous for:
   •  State and context tracking: Color sets can capture the internal
      state of agents or system contexts, allowing transitions to ﬁre
      only when certain conditions (guards) on those states are met.
   •  Protocol deﬁnition and enforcement: Complex interaction
      sequences, including the dynamic creation and distribution of
      tasks, can be succinctly speciﬁed and analyzed.
   •  Integration with communication spaces: As we will see in
      Section 4, communication spaces—surface, observation, and
      computation—can be mapped onto distinct parts of a colored
      Petri net, leveraging types to separate or coordinate diﬀerent
      communication and processing domains.


3.3 Illustrative example

     Figure 1       presents a simpliﬁed Petri net modeling a small
concurrent process. Places are shown as circles, transitions as
rectangles, and arcs indicate the ﬂow of tokens.
     In a colored Petri net version (Figure 2), tokens carry additional
data types that reﬂect the roles or tasks assigned to diﬀerent agents.


3.4 Relevance to hybrid agent systems

     Petri  nets,  and particularly  their  colored  variants,  are
ideally suited to represent the parallel and event-driven nature
of   interactions  among humans      and    AI components. Their
token-based semantics naturally handles concurrency, while the
ability to extend tokens with data types makes them powerful
enough to capture the complexities of heterogeneous, hybrid
agent systems.
        As we will see in the next section, Petri nets’ properties—
particularly  their  ability  to  model     concurrent   processes,
handle      heterogeneous data  types, and     support  both loose
and   tight   coupling—make       them ideal    for    implementing
the   communication    spaces   framework,  which    addresses  the
coordination challenges identiﬁed in our discussion of multi-agent
and Centaurian paradigms.

that can support both approaches. While Petri nets provide a strong
formal foundation for modeling processes and synchronization,
we need to extend their capabilities to capture the complexities of
human-AI collaboration fully. We introduce communication spaces
as this unifying framework, building on Petri nets while adding
specialized structures for handling varied communication styles,
heterogeneous capabilities, and adaptive protocols.


4.1 Foundations and rationale

              Petri nets excel at modeling token ﬂows among well-deﬁned
places, but in       hybrid human-AI systems, we   face additional
challenges. Agents diﬀer widely in perceiving, processing, and
sharing information:        humans communicate   through natural
language, AI systems through structured data, and physical devices
through sensor signals. Moreover, these communication patterns
must adapt dynamically as the system shifts between loose coupling
(characteristic of   multi-agent   systems) and tight   integration
(needed in Centaurian conﬁgurations). These requirements call
for a framework that can accommodate asymmetric interaction
capabilities while supporting both autonomous operation and deep
cognitive fusion.


A mini-example of heterogeneous agents
            Consider a team as shown in Figure 3 with a human operator,
an LLM-based conversational agent, and a swarm of simple robotic
drones. The human and LLM exchange strategic decisions via
text-based conversation, while the drones communicate real-time
state updates in a lightweight sensor-data format. Additionally,
the human observes a video feed of drone activity. Each of these
“channels” imposes diﬀerent synchronization rules, data formats,
and reliability guarantees—precisely the nuances communication
spaces help formalize.


4.2 Core ideas of communication spaces

    Communication         spaces  group  interactions  into       three
conceptual layers (Borghoﬀ et al., 2024a):    surface, observation,
and computation.     Whether      in  a  multi-agent   (MAS) or a
Centaurian   system, each    space   encapsulates a coherent set
of    interaction rules and  constraints.  The formation of these
spaces     typically  involves either point-to-point or  broadcast
communication², or communication through the environment³.
Several    examples   illustrate  this  multi-agent organization of
communication spaces:

    •  In Mobile      Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), mobile devices
       communicate with one another via wireless links without
       relying on an underlying infrastructure: each device acts
       as both an endpoint and a router forwarding messages to
       devices within radio range. Software support for MANETs
       typically presents a coordination layer that sends speciﬁc
       messages to individual agents to guarantee the execution
       of  cooperative  processes while    considering the need         for
       connectivity continuance. In Bottoni et al. (2006), a formal
       model of the coordination mechanisms was given in terms of
       High-Level Petri nets.
    •  Management of transportation networks requires maintaining
       complete information on the whereabouts of vehicles and
       the state of roads to be mapped on the topology of the
       transportation network (see Ciancia et al. (2018) for a concrete
       example). Then, the overall state of the transportation system
       is given by the information of which vehicle is at which
       node of the network, information which has to be maintained
       consistently for each vehicle.


2   Point-to-point or broadcast communication often uses message passing
as a crucial concept in many system interactions, especially in distributed
systems, concurrent programming, or event-driven architectures like ours.
It  allows diﬀerent   components  (agents, large action models, etc.)    to
communicate without internal knowledge of the other system (decoupling),
making it easy to add more components to a messaging-coupled system
(scalability). Even diﬀerent messaging protocols can be easily implemented
and exchanged spontaneously (ﬂexibility), with some protocols allowing
asynchronous interaction     in which   the sender and  receiver do  not
have to work simultaneously (asynchrony).   Xiao et al. (2020)   presents a
comprehensive overview and analysis of the most advanced blockchain
consensus protocols based on message passing.
3     Shared memory architectures can form such an environmental common
ground in the Bradshaw et al. (2011) sense.

Observation space
Bridging    the  surface interface     with internal  processing,
observation space handles message      transformations, routing,
and light coordination. In MAS, protocols here ensure agents
remain autonomous yet    cooperative.  In   Centaurian  systems,
observation may feature continuous feedback loops that unify
human perception with AI analysis.


Computation space
Serving as the “core” of the system, the computational space
makes decisions, allocates resources, and generates ﬁnal outputs.
MAS solutions often involve multiple autonomous modules, each
coordinating a portion of the computation. In contrast, Centaurian
architectures could fuse human insight with AI algorithms in a
shared decision-making environment.


Flows and feedback
Information travels vertically through these spaces—from raw
input at the surface to internal processing and back. There may also
be horizontal ﬂows where agents collaborate within a given space.
Feedback loops enable adaptive behavior, such as reﬁning protocols
or redistributing tasks in real time based on performance.
Each of these spaces can be seen as managed by an associated
group-agent, facilitating distributed problem-solving among a
group of users within a networked system or application. The
structure of a group-agent is schematized in Figure 6, where the
ID and ST compartment are common to all agents. Then, the
COMPOSITION compartment is speciﬁc to a group-agent, while
other agents have speciﬁc additional members for deﬁning their
state, and are endowed with a set of behaviors.
Group-agents are     relevant in collaborative systems  where
multiple users and agents work together to solve complex problems
or tasks and proper delivery of messages is crucial to ensure
that each participant is correctly informed of the overall progress
toward task achievement. A group-agent can be created at any
time with respect to a topic and its register behavior regulates
composition modiﬁcation through a protocol which respects the
localization constraints. The following pseudo-code provides an
abstract speciﬁcation of the construction of group-agents for
communication spaces.

     The information about the activity status of an agent registered
to a group is updated through the switch behavior
and AI   sensory input  within the   surface space,     creating a

corresponding to data formats or message semantics relevant to
each space. Transition guards incorporate rules for agent-speciﬁc
capabilities (e.g., a color set may denote “human text command” vs.
“drone sensor data”).
This enriched formalism preserves the tractability of standard
Petri nets while accommodating the specialized interactions of
heterogeneous agents. For example, transitions in the observation
space can ﬁre only when tokens of type “parsed command” are
present, ensuring that raw data never bypasses the necessary
transformation steps.


Example snippet
            Imagine a transition as shown in Figure 7 in the computation
space labeled Assign Task, which ﬁres only when it receives both
a “planning token” from the LLM agent and an “approval token”
from the human. Such a rule encapsulates the synergy sought in
a Centaurian design, formalizing how human sign-oﬀ triggers an
AI-based planning process.
           A system may operate predominantly in MAS mode for routine
tasks, yet temporarily shift to a more Centaurian-like strategy
when it encounters novel or ambiguous conditions. This capacity
to blend paradigms on demand underscores the ﬂexibility of
communication spaces.
     The beneﬁts can be summarized as follows: By demarcating
surface,    observation,  and computation  spaces  within  a
uniﬁed      Petri  net  model, designers gain  a clear      blueprint
for  structuring   agent  interactions.  This  approach       enables
them to capitalize on the strengths of both multi-agent and
Centaurian  paradigms—maintaining        well-deﬁned    boundaries
when necessary,    but    also allowing  for deep integration     and
emergent    capabilities  where advantageous.  The next sections
illustrate  how    communication spaces      operate in  real-world
scenarios,  further     emphasizing their role in building robust
human-AI systems.


5 Use case 1: multi-agent interaction


4.5 Implementation considerations

            Implementing communication spaces requires careful attention
to the following aspects:     State management        ensures consistent
updates across distributed agents or fused human-AI modules,
especially in time-sensitive environments. Resource allocation deals
with balancing computational load, bandwidth, and potential real-
time constraints. Protocol adaptation supports switching between
agent autonomy (MAS) and deeper integration (Centaurian) based
on changing system goals or unexpected conditions.
with satellite and swarm robots

     This use case demonstrates how our theoretical framework
accommodates both multi-agent and Centaurian paradigms within
a complex system. While predominantly exhibiting multi-agent
characteristics through its distributed architecture, the system also
incorporates Centaurian elements in speciﬁc human-AI interaction
points. Figure 8 illustrates the data ﬂow in an experiment with a
semi-centralized coordinated swarm of robots, using both “rigid”
optimization algorithms and “ﬂexible” intervention through a large
language model (LLM). This setup encapsulates a true multi-agent

5.1 System overview


              The system exempliﬁes the multi-agent paradigm through
its composition of distinct, autonomous components: a satellite
control unit, a swarm of robotic agents, an LLM, and human
operators.   Each  agent       maintains its     own      decision-making
capabilities while participating in      the  collective process. The
satellite provides centralized coordination and processes the data
collected by the swarm, while the LLM oﬀers strategic advice on
algorithm selection and parameter tuning. The human operators
are not just supervisors, but autonomous agents who monitor these
interactions and intervene to guide the system through complex
decision processes.

complement each other. For path optimization        and adaptive
problem solving, the system primarily operates in a multi-agent
mode, with the LLM acting as an independent advisor. However,
when human operators review and implement suggestions, the
interaction temporarily shifts to a Centaurian mode, creating a
tightly integrated human-AI decision unit. For example, in path
planning, the LLM can suggest changes to curve parameters based
on detected obstacles or changes in terrain, maintaining its agent
independence, while human operators review these suggestions
through a Centaurian-style deep integration process.

                The implementation of agent interactions has been explored
through    various  computational approaches.       Basic      interaction
protocols  have    been formalized for    distributed          computation
(Aspnes and Ruppert, 2009), while more complex patterns have
been developed for knowledge combination (Andreoli et al., 1994;
Borghoﬀ and Schlichter, 1996) and distributed problem-solving
(Borghoﬀ et al., 1998). Recent work has focused on higher-level
interactions, particularly in intention recognition (de Greef et al.,
2007; Inga et al., 2023), which is becoming increasingly important
as artiﬁcial agents grow more sophisticated in their ability to
understand and respond to human goals.
                  Guamán et al. (2021) presents an innovative unsupervised
clustering theory using self-organizing maps to classify               MVC
patterns   based  on software  quality metrics      in   a      continuous
interaction process. Their goal is to identify quality features that
determine the similarity of MVC applications without architectural
bias.  Lawless and Sofge (2021)              use interdependence theory to
determine whether convergence has a positive or negative eﬀect
in a competition between human and artiﬁcial agents, as in system
dynamics models.
             Mobile applications, as well as satellite and swarm robotics,
have   grown     signiﬁcantly in recent years,  with         architectural
patterns   playing  a critical role in  their success.     To   ensure
the correct implementation of an MVC pattern,                  Dobrean and

enhance coordination and security in swarm robotic systems,

that   integrates blockchain   technology, featuring     a     centralized
control   unit   that coordinates   the   swarm,    while       blockchain
technology ensures secure and decentralized data storage and
communication. Kumar and Choppella (2023) take the opposite
approach,    extending  pattern   descriptions      with a System       of
Systems    (SoS)  model      to  apply interactive    dynamics  to      an
MVC pattern.

been reported. For example, Choudhuri et al. (2024) state that
there were no statistical diﬀerences in participants’ productivity
or self-eﬃcacy when using ChatGPT compared to traditional
resources. Instead, they found    signiﬁcantly  higher frustration
levels, identifying ﬁve distinct errors resulting from violations of
human-AI interaction guidelines, leading to various (negative)
consequences for the participants.
    LLMs are increasingly being used in studies to investigate the
interaction between humans and artiﬁcial agents. Borghoﬀ et al.

Nascimento et al. (2023) evaluates ChatGPT-generated code against
developer-generated code to determine which tasks are better
suited for engineers and which are better handled by AI. This
could lead to more eﬃcient interaction (e.g., AI as a tutor for SE
developers) and provide new insights into innovative AI strategies
that include the involvement of   humans-in-the-loop   to support
the tasks of software engineering. Capitanelli and Mastrogiovanni

    Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) (Papillon et al.,

aforementioned message-passing paradigm to capture interactions
between entities (often represented as nodes in a graph). In
MPNNs, nodes in a graph communicate with their neighbors
through a series of message-passing steps. This interaction allows
the network to learn representations by aggregating information
from neighboring nodes; see also the RABBIT use case in Section 6.
    A formal model of the global activity of a system of agents

where agents act according to individual strategies    by which to

systems leads to the deﬁnition of some variations of Alternating-
Time   Temporal   Logic   (see   e.g.,  Alur et al.,  2002; Alechina
et al., 2017;   Mogavero et al., 2017). In contrast, a logic that
incorporates spatial constraints on a par with temporal ones has
been recently proposed by Bottoni et al. (2024). In general, these
models abstract the actual mechanisms through which information
about states can be exchanged among agents and assume that
all agents act rationally regarding their strategies. The level of
non-determinism inherent to considering human agents would,
therefore, require some adaptation of these logics in the direction

of identifying classes of agents that can follow several strategies
at once.
     Although   beyond   the scope     of this paper, there exists    a
humanistic perspective (Knell and Rüther, 2024), as well as an
ethical dimension, to human-artiﬁcial interaction. For the latter,
the reader is referred to Kumar and Choudhury (2023b), Karlan
(2023) and Nieto (2024). In some ways, “virtual superhuman” AI
technologies could undermine the value of human achievements
(Schaap et al., 2024) or even may pose an existential threat (Kumar
and Choudhury, 2023a).

8 Conclusion and future work


             We have outlined a framework that systematically considers
how human and artiﬁcial agents interact within a networked
ecosystem.   By articulating HCI not      just as        human-computer
interactions but as dynamic interactions among diﬀerent agents
within      a ﬂexible, multi-agent   system,   we have      highlighted
the  potential  for    more  complex      and  eﬀective   interactions.
The  application      of our multi-agent  model   to    two    diﬀerent
use  cases—satellite     and swarm     robotics,  and   Large    Action
Models        (LAMs)—has  not  only       validated  our    theoretical
constructs, but also underscored the practical implications of
such interactions.
     In the ﬁrst use case, we observed how a semi-centralized
system, enabled by a large language model, could improve decision-
making processes and adaptability through real-time data-driven
adjustments. This setup not only ensures eﬃciency, but also
preserves human oversight, which is critical for managing complex,
dynamic environments.
                 The second use case involving LAMs further highlighted
the potential of integrating advanced computational agents to
predict and shape human-computer interactions. Using neuro-
symbolic programming, the LAM framework demonstrated its
ability to reﬁne its operations based on continuous feedback
from human interactions, promoting an adaptive and responsive
HCI system.
     We have    thus     established a  foundational  framework         for
the  design     and   analysis of HCI     systems    that views       these
interactions    as  a  complex interplay  among      multiple   agents.
This approach allows us to better understand and harness the
collective    capabilities  of diﬀerent   agents, thereby     enhancing
the  system’s      adaptability  and   resilience.   Importantly,  this
perspective    aligns    with  emerging   technology  paradigms    that
foster a deep understanding and integration of human agents.
Indeed, our contribution can be seen as a systemic evolution
in   design   approaches,     emphasizing the front-end to      enhance
usability and eﬀectiveness. This contrasts with, but complements,
systemic approaches that prioritize the back-end for security and
robustness, as illustrated by Salzano et al. (2023). Together, these
perspectives synergistically improve the overall architecture of
HCI systems.
     The integration of human and artiﬁcial agents also raises critical
ethical and regulatory considerations. Our framework’s layered
communication spaces–surface, observation, and computation–
provide inherent auditability through explicit transition logs and
token-based interaction traces, aligning with AI accountability
guidelines (Floridi, 2019;     EU, 2024). For high-stakes domains
such as healthcare or defense, this enables clear attribution of
decisions to human or AI agents, while preserving the ﬂuidity of
Centaurian collaboration. Future work will further formalize these
mechanisms to ensure compliance with emerging standards for
hybrid intelligence systems.
      Ultimately, our study enriches the understanding of HCI
as a dynamic and evolving ﬁeld characterized by the complex
yet   symbiotic relationships between humans and        machines.
As we delve deeper into these interactions, the possibility of
transforming human-computer interactions into more seamless
and   eﬀective  experiences becomes increasingly tangible. This
promises a future in which the human and artiﬁcial dimensions
are   not  merely aligned   but fully  integrated in a balanced
and complementary manner. Such integration could pave the
way   for  a   new era  of  collective and hybrid intelligence—
where humans and machines work closely together—potentially
the most signiﬁcant and immediate outcome of current rapid
technological advances.
      Future research will focus on improving the adaptability of
MAS by addressing the challenge of dynamic team composition.
Standard Petri nets, with their static structure, have diﬃculty
accommodating      scenarios where  agents join   or leave while
maintaining consensus, as illustrated by the    register          and
deregister      (for active  agents)   pseudo-code in Section  4.
Therefore, we plan to model agents as individual (colored) Petri
nets with specialized input and output locations, allowing token-
based message passing for seamless registration and deregistration.
However, smooth coordination requires high-level reconﬁguration
mechanisms to dynamically manage agent lifecycles. While these
improvements    enhance    the adaptability of MAS,   Centaurian
systems, with their stable human-AI integration, remain well-
suited to Petri net formalization due to their reliance on ﬁxed
coordination structures.
      Another   important    future  research  direction  is  the
development     of a hybrid    approach that   bridges MAS        and
Centaurian systems. While Petri nets eﬀectively model structured
Centaurian     intelligence,  where  human  and   AI   components
collaborate through predeﬁned coordination rules, they fall short
in dynamic MAS scenarios that require self-organization. Future
research will therefore integrate high-level reconﬁgurable networks
to enable agent ﬂuidity, while using communication spaces as an
intermediate layer for seamless coordination between autonomous
and tightly coupled agents. This three-tiered approach will enable
dynamic transitions between structured Centaurian intelligence
and   decentralized  MAS      interactions.  Given the  increasing
importance of Centaurian AI in human-computer collaboration,
this  hybrid   framework      will  improve  eﬃciency,  adaptability,
and interoperability.
      An  alternative  set-theoretic   approach    abstracts    agent
relationships   without       rigid  network   structures,  deﬁning
interactions through set membership and relational mappings.
While this circumvents the limitations of Petri nets in dynamic
scenarios,   its  implementation     requires  structured   protocols
for   message     ﬂow  and    consistency. Our future  research will
therefore explore how set-theoretic models can complement Petri
