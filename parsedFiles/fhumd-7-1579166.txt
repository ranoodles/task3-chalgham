This paper presents a novel perspective on human-computer inte raction
(HCI), framing it as a dynamic interplay between human and computa tional
agents within a networked system. Going beyond traditional inte rface-
based approaches, we emphasize the importance of coordination and
communication among heterogeneous agents with diﬀerent capabil ities,
roles, and goals. The paper distinguishes between Multi-Age nt Systems
(MAS)—where agents maintain autonomy through structured coope ration—
and Centaurian systems, which integrate human and AI capabilities for
uniﬁed decision making. To formalize these interactions, we int roduce a
framework for communication spaces, structured into surface, obse rvation,
and computation layers, ensuring seamless integration betwe en MAS and
Centaurian architectures, where colored Petri nets eﬀectively r epresent
structured Centaurian systems and high-level reconﬁgurable networks address
the dynamic nature of MAS. We recognize that elements such as task
recommendation, feedback loops, and natural language interf aces are common
in contemporary adaptive HCI. What distinguishes our framewo rk is not the
introduction of these elements per se , but the synthesis of architectural
principles that systematically accommodate both autonomy-pres erving and
integration-seeking conﬁgurations within a shared formal foun dation. Our
research has practical applications in autonomous robotics, hum an-in-the-
loop decision making, and AI-driven cognitive architectures, and provides
a foundation for next-generation hybrid intelligence syste ms that balance
structured coordination with emergent behavior.

/one.tnum Introduction
Agentic AI systems—capable of iterative planning, autonomous task decomposition,
and continuous learning—are rapidly reshaping the landscape of human-computer
interaction (HCI). Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced
conversational agents have revitalized the ﬁeld of multi-agent systems, whose roots in
Artiﬁcial Intelligence predate the current rise of generative AI. Historically, multi-agent
systems have relied on agents with relatively limited capabilities; however, the emergence
of powerful, conversational LLMs greatly expands the range of possible multi-agent
interactions. In this new paradigm, humans themselves can participate as full-ﬂedged
agents, thanks to their innate conversational and decision-making abilities. The result is
a complex, interconnected ecosystem (
Hopf et al., 2024 ).

Simultaneously, novel and more direct forms of human-
AI integration are emerging ( Pareschi, 2024 ; Saghaﬁan and
Idan, 2024 ), in which advanced AI cognition is harnessed to
create “Centaurian” intelligence—a seamless fusion of human and
machine-driven capabilities.
These developments push beyond traditional HCI in two
distinct directions that mirror fundamental patterns found in
biological systems (
Borghoﬀ et al., 1995 ; von Bertalanﬀy, 1968 ;
Miller, 1978 ). Multi-agent systems, like biological ecosystems,
emphasize how collections of autonomous entities can coordinate
eﬀectively while preserving distinct boundaries and roles. In
contrast, “Centaurian” systems pursue deeper integration—
analogous to the symbiotic relationships in nature—fusing human
and artiﬁcial competencies in tightly knit partnerships that
often blur the lines between human decision making and AI-
driven processes. Living systems theory (
Maturana and Varela,
1980) helps us understand how both approaches must address
a core challenge: maintaining system identity through regulated
boundaries and feedback loops (
Wiener, 1948), whether in loosely
coupled collectives or tightly integrated hybrid intelligences.
From an ethical and regulatory perspective, the blurring of
boundaries between human and artiﬁcial agents raises critical
issues of accountability and transparency. As hybrid systems
increasingly share decision-making authority between human and
AI components, especially in domains such as healthcare, defense,
or ﬁnance, it becomes essential to ensure traceable paths of
action and deﬁne clear loci of control. By preserving observable
communication layers and explicit transitions, our architectural
model supports auditability and human oversight even in deeply
integrated Centaurian conﬁgurations. While our goal is primarily
analytical rather than normative, we recognize that formal clarity
in modeling is a prerequisite for ethical deployment.
Herbert Simon’s inﬂuential work on cognitive architectures
(
Simon, 1996) provides additional insight into how such human-AI
integration might be structured. His tripartite model—comprising
an external interface, a coding mechanism, and an internal
processing system—was originally conceived to explain human
problem-solving but extends naturally to hybrid systems. When
human abilities merge with artiﬁcial intelligence, the resulting
conﬁguration can evolve from traditional tool use ( Homo Faber )
to a more profound integration ( Centaurus Faber ) where each
component may be instantiated by either human cognition or AI
subsystems (
Pareschi, 2024). This perspective suggests how system
boundaries might be organized to support both autonomous
operation and deep integration.
The framework proposed in this paper serves a dual purpose:
ﬁrst, as a design methodology for structuring hybrid human-
AI systems, and second, as an analytical lens for understanding
their coordination dynamics. While not prescriptive in a regulatory
sense, it oﬀers a normative foundation for evaluating the degree and
quality of integration between agents. Its modular structure also
allows it to be adapted for formal veriﬁcation and implementation
in real-world systems.
To address these architectural challenges, we introduce a formal
framework based on Petri nets (
Petri, 1962 ; Murata, 1989 ) that
can model both multi-agent and Centaurian paradigms while
supporting the key requirements suggested by living systems theory
and Simon’s architecture: clear boundaries, regulated interactions,
and adaptive feedback loops. Unlike graph-based agent frameworks
(
Wooldridge, 2002 ; Weiss, 2013 ), which prioritize topological
relationships but struggle with dynamic concurrency, Petri nets
oﬀer native support for parallel processes and state transitions via
token semantics, critical for hybrid human-AI systems. Colored
Petri nets (
Jensen, 1995 ), in particular, allow us to encode
heterogeneous data, agent roles, and interaction semantics—
key to modeling learning, adaptation, and reasoning in hybrid
agent conﬁgurations.
Our approach, grounded in rigorous process modeling,
provides a uniﬁed way to specify how heterogeneous agents—
human and artiﬁcial—can coordinate their activities while either
maintaining autonomy or achieving deeper integration as needed.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 analyzes two fundamental paradigms in human-machine
collaboration—the multi-agent approach and the Centaurian one—
in light of the recent resurgence of agentic AI. Section 3 provides
foundational background on Petri nets and their extensions.
Section 4 introduces the concept of communication spaces as
a unifying framework for these paradigms, grounded in formal
architectures and coordination mechanisms. Sections 5 and 6
illustrate these ideas with two use cases, demonstrating how
communication spaces can be applied in practical HCI scenarios.
Section 7 discusses related work, and Section 8 concludes with
implications and future directions.
/two.tnum Paradigms in human-AI integration
Agentic AI systems have reinvigorated two distinct approaches
to human-AI collaboration: multi-agent architectures and
Centaurian integration. This section examines these paradigms in
detail, highlighting the distinct challenges each presents for system
design and coordination.
Indeed, although both paradigms involve interactions between
intelligent entities, they represent fundamentally diﬀerent
approaches to human-artiﬁcial collaboration (
Pareschi, 2024 ).
Multi-agent systems maintain distinct boundaries between
components while enabling complex interactions, much like
natural ecosystems. In contrast, Centaurian systems mirror
the tight integration seen in biological organisms, where
components merge functionally to create new capabilities
(
Saghaﬁan and Idan, 2024 ).
/two.tnum./one.tnum Architectural diﬀerences
The primary architectural distinction lies in how these systems
organize and maintain their identity ( Pareschi, 2024).
Multi-agent systems (MAS) emphasize functional
independence, where agents—human or artiﬁcial—operate as
distinct entities with decision-making capabilities and dynamic
collaboration. This design has allowed MAS implementations
to thrive even with relatively simple AI agents, focusing on
coordination rather than deep integration.
Centaurian systems, by contrast, create uniﬁed composite
entities where human and artiﬁcial components become
functionally interdependent. Theoretical foundations for such
systems trace back to
Licklider (1960) and Engelbart (1962) , but

Borghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum
their practical feasibility has emerged only recently with generative
AI systems capable of complementing human cognitive functions.
A key concept in both systems is that of communication
spaces—regions of interaction where information exchange and
coordination occur. In biological systems, these are signaling
pathways or neural networks; in human-machine systems, they
manifest as protocols, interfaces, and shared representational
spaces (
Bradshaw et al., 2011 ). These spaces enable “joint
activity”, characterized by inter-predictability, common ground,
and directability.
/two.tnum./two.tnum Integration paradigms, operational
dynamics, and convergence points
Each paradigm embodies diﬀerent principles from living
systems theory: In MAS, collaboration occurs through well-
deﬁned protocols between autonomous agents, resembling distinct
organisms in an ecosystem. Eﬀectiveness emerges from collective
behavior while maintaining individual identities. In Centaurian
systems, integration blurs the boundaries between human and
artiﬁcial components, forming functionally uniﬁed entities similar
to biological organisms.
The ecosystem versus organism analogy extends to
operational dynamics:
• Identity maintenance: MAS preserve distinct agent identities
while allowing interaction while, Centaurian systems create
new composite identities through integration.
• Adaptation mechanisms : MAS adapt via reconﬁguration of
agent relationships, while Centaurian systems evolve through
internal transformation of integrated components.
• System boundaries : MAS maintain clear boundaries with
well-deﬁned interfaces, while Centaurian systems develop
permeable boundaries for deep functional integration.
Despite these distinctions, some scenarios blur the boundaries
between paradigms, especially in adaptive complex systems.
Consider large action models (LAMs), where human operators
provide training feedback to artiﬁcial systems. Depending on
the context, these interactions can manifest as multi-agent
collaboration or Centaurian integration. Such convergence points
suggest that while the paradigms are conceptually distinct, they can
complement each other in practice.
/two.tnum./three.tnum Implications for system design
Viewing these paradigms through the lens of living systems
theory has key design implications: The MAS design focus
is on preserving agent autonomy, developing protocols for
eﬀective coordination, and ensuring system resilience through
independent agents. Centaurian systems , on the other hand, have
a design focus on emphasizing functional integration mechanisms,
developing shared representational spaces, and encouraging
emergent capabilities.
Section 4 will introduce communication spaces as a unifying
framework supporting both paradigms, thus enabling both the
loose coupling of MAS and the tight integration of Centaurian
systems while preserving their core attributes.
/two.tnum./four.tnum Situating human-machine
collaboration in the context of agentic AI
Advances in agentic AI heighten the relevance of multi-agent
and Centaurian systems. Unlike traditional AI chatbots, agentic AI
systems engage in sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to
solve complex, multi-step problems autonomously. These systems
follow a four-step cycle of perception, reasoning, action, and
learning, continuously improving over time.
Our framework provides a theoretical foundation for
integrating agentic AI into human-machine collaboration. It
is intended to be used primarily for system design, analytical
modeling, and normative assessment. The multi-agent paradigm
aligns with contexts where agentic AI must maintain autonomy
while coordinating with human and artiﬁcial agents via deﬁned
protocols—such as in distributed customer service or collaborative
software development.
Conversely, the Centaurian paradigm is critical for cases that
require deep integration with human operators, such as healthcare
or video analytics, where AI seamlessly blends with human
expertise and decision making. The tight coupling characteristic
of Centaurian systems enables ﬂuid interactions for complex tasks
that require human judgment alongside AI-driven analysis.
As agentic AI systems grow more sophisticated, the interplay
between these paradigms becomes more dynamic. For instance,
an enterprise AI system might operate independently (multi-agent
mode) for routine tasks while tightly integrating with human
experts (Centaurian mode) for complex decisions. Our framework
supports the understanding and design of such interactions.
Additionally, the “data ﬂywheel” eﬀect—continuous learning
and adaptation—aligns with our model’s emphasis on system
evolution. Learning occurs both in the improvement of
independent agents (multi-agent paradigm) and in the reﬁnement
of human-AI integration patterns (Centaurian paradigm),
demonstrating how our framework accommodates various aspects
of agentic AI development.
/three.tnum Technical background: Petri nets
To provide a rigorous foundation for modeling the complex
interactions in both multi-agent and Centaurian systems, we
employ Petri nets as our core formal framework. Petri nets
present several advantages for our purpose: they oﬀer a
clear graphical representation while maintaining mathematical
precision, they naturally capture concurrent processes and
synchronization requirements, and they can be extended to handle
sophisticated data types and conditions through their colored
variants. These properties make them especially well-suited for
modeling interactions among heterogeneous agents, whether in
loosely coupled multi-agent conﬁgurations or tightly integrated
Centaurian systems. This section introduces the key concepts of
Petri nets and their extensions, which will serve as the formal basis
for our communication spaces framework.

Borghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum
Petri nets are a well-established formalism for describing and
analyzing the ﬂow of information and control in concurrent
systems. Originally introduced by
Petri (1962) , they have evolved
into a family of models widely applied in computer science, systems
engineering, and workﬂow management. A Petri net consists of
places, transitions, and arcs connecting places to transitions (or
vice versa), with the system’s state captured by tokens that reside
in places. As transitions ﬁre, tokens move among places, thus
modeling the progress of a process or distributed computation
(
Murata, 1989).
/three.tnum./one.tnum Basic concepts and advantages
• Graphical clarity : One of the key strengths of Petri nets
is their visual nature. Processes, resource constraints, and
synchronization points are represented in a diagram, oﬀering
an intuitive view of concurrent interactions. This makes Petri
nets well-suited for communicating system designs to both
technical and non-technical stakeholders.
• Explicit concurrency : Petri nets explicitly capture
concurrency by allowing multiple transitions to ﬁre
independently if they have suﬃcient tokens in their input
places. This feature provides a natural way to represent
multi-agent or multi-component systems where actions may
proceed in parallel.
• Formal analysis tools: A rich ecosystem of analysis techniques
(e.g., reachability, liveness, boundedness) and software tools
(e.g., colored Petri nets Tools
/one.tnum) exists for verifying properties
of Petri net models ( Jensen, 1995 ). This is particularly useful
for systems requiring rigorous guarantees, such as safety-
critical applications or complex human-AI workﬂows.
• Modularity and extensibility : Petri nets provide a modular
framework that can be extended to various specialized forms
(e.g., timed, stochastic, colored), allowing the designer to
incorporate speciﬁc features such as timing constraints,
probabilistic behavior, or typed tokens.
/three.tnum./two.tnum Colored Petri nets and typed tokens
While classical Petri nets use indistinguishable tokens to
mark places, colored Petri nets extend this model by assigning
types or colors to tokens. Places become typed containers, and
transitions can incorporate guard functions that enable more
complex behaviors (
Jensen, 1995 ). This extension allows designers
to encode complex data structures and interaction protocols
directly in the net, signiﬁcantly increasing expressiveness. In the
context of hybrid agent systems, colored Petri nets are especially
advantageous for:
• Heterogeneous agents: Diﬀerent types of tokens can represent
messages, tasks, or capabilities unique to human and
synthetic agents.
/one.tnumhttps://cpnide.org/
FIGURE /one.tnum
A simple Petri net example showing two places and one transition .
• State and context tracking : Color sets can capture the internal
state of agents or system contexts, allowing transitions to ﬁre
only when certain conditions (guards) on those states are met.
• Protocol deﬁnition and enforcement : Complex interaction
sequences, including the dynamic creation and distribution of
tasks, can be succinctly speciﬁed and analyzed.
• Integration with communication spaces : As we will see in
Section 4, communication spaces—surface, observation, and
computation—can be mapped onto distinct parts of a colored
Petri net, leveraging types to separate or coordinate diﬀerent
communication and processing domains.
/three.tnum./three.tnum Illustrative example
Figure 1 presents a simpliﬁed Petri net modeling a small
concurrent process. Places are shown as circles, transitions as
rectangles, and arcs indicate the ﬂow of tokens.
In a colored Petri net version (
Figure 2), tokens carry additional
data types that reﬂect the roles or tasks assigned to diﬀerent agents.
/three.tnum./four.tnum Relevance to hybrid agent systems
Petri nets, and particularly their colored variants, are
ideally suited to represent the parallel and event-driven nature
of interactions among humans and AI components. Their
token-based semantics naturally handles concurrency, while the
ability to extend tokens with data types makes them powerful
enough to capture the complexities of heterogeneous, hybrid
agent systems.
As we will see in the next section, Petri nets’ properties—
particularly their ability to model concurrent processes,
handle heterogeneous data types, and support both loose
and tight coupling—make them ideal for implementing
the communication spaces framework, which addresses the
coordination challenges identiﬁed in our discussion of multi-agent
and Centaurian paradigms.
/four.tnum Communication spaces and agent
architectures
The contrasting requirements of multi-agent and Centaurian
paradigms—maintaining clear boundaries in one case while
enabling deep integration in the other—call for a uniﬁed framework

that can support both approaches. While Petri nets provide a strong
formal foundation for modeling processes and synchronization,
we need to extend their capabilities to capture the complexities of
human-AI collaboration fully. We introduce communication spaces
as this unifying framework, building on Petri nets while adding
specialized structures for handling varied communication styles,
heterogeneous capabilities, and adaptive protocols.
/four.tnum./one.tnum Foundations and rationale
Petri nets excel at modeling token ﬂows among well-deﬁned
places, but in hybrid human-AI systems, we face additional
challenges. Agents diﬀer widely in perceiving, processing, and
sharing information: humans communicate through natural
language, AI systems through structured data, and physical devices
through sensor signals. Moreover, these communication patterns
must adapt dynamically as the system shifts between loose coupling
(characteristic of multi-agent systems) and tight integration
(needed in Centaurian conﬁgurations). These requirements call
for a framework that can accommodate asymmetric interaction
capabilities while supporting both autonomous operation and deep
cognitive fusion.
A mini-example of heterogeneous agents
Consider a team as shown in
Figure 3 with a human operator,
an LLM-based conversational agent, and a swarm of simple robotic
drones. The human and LLM exchange strategic decisions via
text-based conversation, while the drones communicate real-time
state updates in a lightweight sensor-data format. Additionally,
the human observes a video feed of drone activity. Each of these
“channels” imposes diﬀerent synchronization rules, data formats,
and reliability guarantees—precisely the nuances communication
spaces help formalize.
/four.tnum./two.tnum Core ideas of communication spaces
Communication spaces group interactions into three
conceptual layers (
Borghoﬀ et al., 2024a ): surface, observation,
and computation. Whether in a multi-agent (MAS) or a
Centaurian system, each space encapsulates a coherent set
of interaction rules and constraints. The formation of these
spaces typically involves either point-to-point or broadcast
communication
/two.tnum, or communication through the environment /three.tnum.
Several examples illustrate this multi-agent organization of
communication spaces:
• In Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), mobile devices
communicate with one another via wireless links without
relying on an underlying infrastructure: each device acts
as both an endpoint and a router forwarding messages to
devices within radio range. Software support for MANETs
typically presents a coordination layer that sends speciﬁc
messages to individual agents to guarantee the execution
of cooperative processes while considering the need for
connectivity continuance. In
Bottoni et al. (2006) , a formal
model of the coordination mechanisms was given in terms of
High-Level Petri nets.
• Management of transportation networks requires maintaining
complete information on the whereabouts of vehicles and
the state of roads to be mapped on the topology of the
transportation network (see
Ciancia et al. (2018) for a concrete
example). Then, the overall state of the transportation system
is given by the information of which vehicle is at which
node of the network, information which has to be maintained
consistently for each vehicle.
/two.tnum Point-to-point or broadcast communication often uses message passing
as a crucial concept in many system interactions, especially i n distributed
systems, concurrent programming, or event-driven architecture s like ours.
It allows diﬀerent components (agents, large action models, etc.) t o
communicate without internal knowledge of the other system (decoup ling),
making it easy to add more components to a messaging-coupled system
(scalability). Even diﬀerent messaging protocols can be easily implemented
and exchanged spontaneously (ﬂexibility), with some protocols all owing
asynchronous interaction in which the sender and receiver do not
have to work simultaneously (asynchrony).
Xiao et al. (/two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum)presents a
comprehensive overview and analysis of the most advanced blockc hain
consensus protocols based on message passing.
/three.tnum Shared memory architectures can form such an environmental common
ground in the

A layered architecture for HCI.
• In the classical work by Dorigo et al. (2006) , a computational
model was derived from how ants communicate information
on trails to reach food sources by marking them through
pheromones recognized by other ants. The computational
model was, therefore, based on associating weights to paths
to a result and strengthening those associated with a
successful one.
Figure 4 shows a layered architecture similar to the Model-
View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, where executive agents
implement the actual computations, observer agents realize
a bridge between the computations, thereby managing the
formatting of data for presentation and decoding user interactive
commands and data entry, and surface agents (or mediators)
are responsible for maintaining the presentation of the overall
state to the users, thereby managing the materialization of the
formatted data and the presentation layout, and providing support
for capturing user interactions.
Note that in this architecture, the actions performed by the
executive agents, and not just their results, can be subject to
observation. Vertical structuring is also shown, relating surface
agents and executive agents through an observation space (see
Figure 5).
Surface space
This space mediates all contact with the outside environment—
user interfaces, sensors, and external APIs. In MAS, surface space
typically involves message-passing protocols or event listeners. In
Centaurian systems, it can reﬂect a direct blending of human
sensory input and AI-driven data capture.

Schematization of communication spaces in the proposed architec ture.
Observation space
Bridging the surface interface with internal processing,
observation space handles message transformations, routing,
and light coordination. In MAS, protocols here ensure agents
remain autonomous yet cooperative. In Centaurian systems,
observation may feature continuous feedback loops that unify
human perception with AI analysis.
Computation space
Serving as the “core” of the system, the computational space
makes decisions, allocates resources, and generates ﬁnal outputs.
MAS solutions often involve multiple autonomous modules, each
coordinating a portion of the computation. In contrast, Centaurian
architectures could fuse human insight with AI algorithms in a
shared decision-making environment.
Flows and feedback
Information travels vertically through these spaces—from raw
input at the surface to internal processing and back. There may also
be horizontal ﬂows where agents collaborate within a given space.
Feedback loops enable adaptive behavior, such as reﬁning protocols
or redistributing tasks in real time based on performance.
Each of these spaces can be seen as managed by an associated
group-agent, facilitating distributed problem-solving among a
group of users within a networked system or application. The
structure of a group-agent is schematized in
Figure 6, where the
ID and ST compartment are common to all agents. Then, the
COMPOSITION compartment is speciﬁc to a group-agent, while
other agents have speciﬁc additional members for deﬁning their
state, and are endowed with a set of behaviors.
Group-agents are relevant in collaborative systems where
multiple users and agents work together to solve complex problems
or tasks and proper delivery of messages is crucial to ensure
that each participant is correctly informed of the overall progress
toward task achievement. A group-agent can be created at any
time with respect to a topic and its register behavior regulates
composition modiﬁcation through a protocol which respects the
localization constraints. The following pseudo-code provides an
abstract speciﬁcation of the construction of group-agents for
communication spaces.

Similarly, deregistration can occur, when a component is no
longer relevant to a group topic, or due to an explicit decision
by the coordination mechanism. Deregistration can only occur for
active agents.
deregister(self, agent) {
if agent ∈ self.CMP[active] then
self.CMP[active].Remove(agent)
}
The information about the activity status of an agent registered
to a group is updated through the switch behavior

then

/four.tnum./three.tnum Implementing communication spaces
Each of the three spaces can be mapped onto subsets of Petri
net places (or subnets) with typed tokens indicating relevant data,
tasks, or events. This approach partitions a net into self-contained
“zones”, each governed by speciﬁc interaction rules and constraints.
Multi-agent architecture
In a multi-agent system, surface agents manage user
interactions and detect events from the environment, acting
as the system’s interface with external inputs. Observer agents
ensure smooth communication by transforming and routing
messages, enabling coherent collaboration among autonomous
components. Meanwhile, executive agents operate within the
computational space, executing specialized tasks and maintaining
a partial system state to support overall functionality.
A key beneﬁt is clear boundary maintenance and scalability:
each agent type can be added or removed with minimal impact on
the others, provided communication protocols remain consistent.
Centaurian architecture
In Centaurian systems, a uniﬁed interface layer merges human
and AI sensory input within the surface space, creating a
seamless interaction point. A shared observation layer acts as a
bridge between human and AI representations, facilitating smooth
cognitive fusion. Meanwhile, a hybrid processing layer integrates
human reasoning with algorithmic methods, allowing for emergent
collective problem-solving.
Such architectures thrive on adaptability, where boundaries
are permeable and agents can ﬂuidly exchange roles or data to
optimize performance.

corresponding to data formats or message semantics relevant to
each space. Transition guards incorporate rules for agent-speciﬁc
capabilities (e.g., a color set may denote “human text command” vs.
“drone sensor data”).
This enriched formalism preserves the tractability of standard
Petri nets while accommodating the specialized interactions of
heterogeneous agents. For example, transitions in the observation
space can ﬁre only when tokens of type “parsed command” are
present, ensuring that raw data never bypasses the necessary
transformation steps.
Example snippet
Imagine a transition as shown in
Figure 7 in the computation
space labeled Assign Task, which ﬁres only when it receives both
a “planning token” from the LLM agent and an “approval token”
from the human. Such a rule encapsulates the synergy sought in
a Centaurian design, formalizing how human sign-oﬀ triggers an
AI-based planning process.
/four.tnum./five.tnum Implementation considerations
Implementing communication spaces requires careful attention
to the following aspects: State management ensures consistent
updates across distributed agents or fused human-AI modules,
especially in time-sensitive environments. Resource allocation deals
with balancing computational load, bandwidth, and potential real-
time constraints. Protocol adaptation supports switching between
agent autonomy (MAS) and deeper integration (Centaurian) based
on changing system goals or unexpected conditions.
A system may operate predominantly in MAS mode for routine
tasks, yet temporarily shift to a more Centaurian-like strategy
when it encounters novel or ambiguous conditions. This capacity
to blend paradigms on demand underscores the ﬂexibility of
communication spaces.
The beneﬁts can be summarized as follows: By demarcating
surface, observation, and computation spaces within a
uniﬁed Petri net model, designers gain a clear blueprint
for structuring agent interactions. This approach enables
them to capitalize on the strengths of both multi-agent and
Centaurian paradigms—maintaining well-deﬁned boundaries
when necessary, but also allowing for deep integration and
emergent capabilities where advantageous. The next sections
illustrate how communication spaces operate in real-world
scenarios, further emphasizing their role in building robust
human-AI systems.

incorporates Centaurian elements in speciﬁc human-AI interaction

HCI interaction, integrating human operators, conversational AI,
the satellite control unit, and swarm robots.
This use case extends the application of a semi-centralized
control strategy, originally enhanced with blockchain technology
for security and transparency (
Carovilla et al., 2023 ). The multi-
agent paradigm is evident in how distinct entities—the satellite
control unit, swarm robots, LLM, and human operators—maintain
their functional independence while collaborating through well-
deﬁned protocols. However, the system also exhibits Centaurian
characteristics at certain points of interaction, particularly at the
human-LLM interface. The overall information and decision ﬂow,
described in detail in the following sections, is shown in
Figure 9.
/five.tnum./one.tnum System overview
The system exempliﬁes the multi-agent paradigm through
its composition of distinct, autonomous components: a satellite
control unit, a swarm of robotic agents, an LLM, and human
operators. Each agent maintains its own decision-making
capabilities while participating in the collective process. The
satellite provides centralized coordination and processes the data
collected by the swarm, while the LLM oﬀers strategic advice on
algorithm selection and parameter tuning. The human operators
are not just supervisors, but autonomous agents who monitor these
interactions and intervene to guide the system through complex
decision processes.
/five.tnum./two.tnum Integration with LLM and human
operators
The integration layer demonstrates a hybrid approach that
combines both paradigms. Following the multi-agent paradigm, the
LLM interacts with the blockchain and control algorithms as an
independent agent, providing a ﬂexible intelligence layer. However,
the interaction between human operators and the LLM exhibits
Centaurian characteristics, creating a tightly coupled decision unit
where human judgment and AI recommendations are seamlessly
integrated. This dual-nature system remains robust and adaptive
through both the independent operation of its components and the
synergistic human-AI integration points.
/five.tnum./three.tnum Practical applications
The practical applications show how the two paradigms
complement each other. For path optimization and adaptive
problem solving, the system primarily operates in a multi-agent
mode, with the LLM acting as an independent advisor. However,
when human operators review and implement suggestions, the
interaction temporarily shifts to a Centaurian mode, creating a
tightly integrated human-AI decision unit. For example, in path
planning, the LLM can suggest changes to curve parameters based
on detected obstacles or changes in terrain, maintaining its agent
independence, while human operators review these suggestions
through a Centaurian-style deep integration process.
/five.tnum./four.tnum Human-agent collaboration
The collaboration model in this system demonstrates the value
of supporting both paradigms. While the overall architecture
follows multi-agent principles, with human operators functioning
as independent agents within the system, their interaction with the
LLM and control systems often exhibits Centaurian characteristics.
This ﬂexible approach allows the system to leverage both the
independence and coordination capabilities of the multi-agent

interactions
While our ﬁrst use case emphasized the multi-agent paradigm,
this second use case demonstrates a stronger inclination toward
the Centaurian approach, while still maintaining some multi-
agent characteristics.
Figure 10 shows the framework of R ABBIT
TECH ’s Large Action Model (LAM) /four.tnum, which integrates advanced
computational agents to eﬀectively model and predict human
actions on computer applications. The system exempliﬁes the
Centaurian paradigm’s emphasis on tight integration between
human and artiﬁcial components, while incorporating multi-agent
elements in its distributed architecture.
This use case illustrates the transformative potential of LAMs in
creating a new paradigm for human-computer interaction. Unlike
traditional multi-agent systems where components maintain
clear boundaries, Rabbit LAM demonstrates the Centaurian
ideal of deep functional integration, continuously learning from
user input and reﬁning its predictive capabilities. It embodies
/four.tnumhttps://www.rabbit.tech/research
a sophisticated feedback loop system where the boundaries
between human and artiﬁcial intelligence become increasingly
ﬂuid, reﬂecting the core principle of Centaurian systems where
components form an integrated whole rather than remaining
distinct entities.
/six.tnum./one.tnum System overview
The LAM framework in the R ABBIT API exempliﬁes the
Centaurian paradigm through its core components: the LAM node,
human users, and the HCI system, along with representations
of the challenges this integration addresses and the user
experience. Rather than maintaining strict boundaries between
these components, they evolve together through their interactions.
The LAM node, while functioning as a computational agent,
achieves a level of integration with human users that goes
beyond traditional multi-agent relationships, using neuro-symbolic
programming to create a uniﬁed decision-making entity.

systems. This integration enables the execution of complex
tasks across multiple applications with high accuracy and
minimal latency.
For example, consider a LAM processing an ambiguous user
command such as “Schedule a meeting with the team soon.”
The LLM (stochastic) might probabilistically interpret “soon”
as “within 2 days” based on training data, while the symbolic
scheduler (deterministic) enforces a rule that “soon” must map
to a ﬁxed 24-h window. To resolve this, the observation space
(see
Figure 5) mediates between the two layers: the LLM’s proposal
is marked as a “suggestion” token, which triggers a human-
AI negotiation protocol in the computational space. Here, the
system either accepts the LLM’s output with a conﬁdence threshold
(> 80%) or defaults to the symbolic rule, logging the conﬂict
for later reﬁnement. This ensures adaptability while maintaining
traceability—a key requirement for Centaurian systems in high-
stakes domains.
/six.tnum./three.tnum Human-agent interaction
The human-LAM interaction epitomizes the Centaurian ideal
of symbiotic integration. Through a natural language-based user
interface that processes spoken or typed commands, the system
achieves a level of interaction where the boundaries between
human intent and machine execution become increasingly blurred.
The feedback system allows LAM to learn from each interaction,
adapting its models to better match user preferences—a hallmark of
Centaurian systems where components evolve together rather than
merely coordinating their actions.
/six.tnum./four.tnum Practical applications and challenges
LAM’s approach to task management and problem solving
demonstrates the advantages of Centaurian integration over mere
multi-agent coordination. By anticipating user needs and providing
proactive solutions, it shows how deep human-AI integration can
surpass the capabilities of systems in which components merely
coordinate their actions. However, this tight integration poses
unique challenges, including ensuring the transparency of AI
decisions and preserving privacy—challenges that are characteristic
of Centaurian systems, where the boundaries between human and
artiﬁcial components become blurred.
/six.tnum./five.tnum Key takeaways
The feedback loops in LAM exemplify the evolutionary
nature of Centaurian systems. Unlike multi-agent systems where
components maintain ﬁxed identities and interact through
stable protocols, LAM’s feedback loops create a dynamic
system where human and artiﬁcial components grow together,
continuously reﬁning their interaction patterns. This approach
to HCI demonstrates how Centaurian principles can create
more intuitive and responsive computing environments, while

/seven.tnum Related work
The implementation of agent interactions has been explored
through various computational approaches. Basic interaction
protocols have been formalized for distributed computation
(
Aspnes and Ruppert, 2009 ), while more complex patterns have
been developed for knowledge combination ( Andreoli et al., 1994 ;
Borghoﬀ and Schlichter, 1996 ) and distributed problem-solving
(Borghoﬀ et al., 1998 ). Recent work has focused on higher-level
interactions, particularly in intention recognition ( de Greef et al.,
2007; Inga et al., 2023 ), which is becoming increasingly important
as artiﬁcial agents grow more sophisticated in their ability to
understand and respond to human goals.
Guamán et al. (2021) presents an innovative unsupervised
clustering theory using self-organizing maps to classify MVC
patterns based on software quality metrics in a continuous
interaction process. Their goal is to identify quality features that
determine the similarity of MVC applications without architectural
bias.
Lawless and Sofge (2021) use interdependence theory to
determine whether convergence has a positive or negative eﬀect
in a competition between human and artiﬁcial agents, as in system
dynamics models.
Mobile applications, as well as satellite and swarm robotics,
have grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, with architectural
patterns playing a critical role in their success. To ensure
the correct implementation of an MVC pattern,
Dobrean and
Diosan (2022) propose an automated technique that analyzes and
detects architectural issues using data from Software Development
Kits (SDKs) speciﬁcally targeted at mobile code bases. To
enhance coordination and security in swarm robotic systems,
Carovilla et al. (2023) introduce a semi-centralized framework
that integrates blockchain technology, featuring a centralized
control unit that coordinates the swarm, while blockchain
technology ensures secure and decentralized data storage and
communication.
Kumar and Choppella (2023) take the opposite
approach, extending pattern descriptions with a System of
Systems (SoS) model to apply interactive dynamics to an
MVC pattern.
Using the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm as a complex
distributed system that shares a 3-tier architecture consisting of
embedded nodes, gateways that connect an embedded network
to the wider internet, and data services in servers or the
cloud,
Riliskis et al. (2015) propose a novel approach for
programming applications across 3-tiers using a distributed
extension of the MVC architecture. Also in the IoT context,
with a focus on the gaming/sports arena,
Chen (2025) sees
potential for entertainment robots to recognize human posture
through artiﬁcial intelligence. By detecting and monitoring users’
movements in real time, these robots provide a personalized
and interactive entertainment experience.
Caci and Dhou (2020)
also discuss the interplay between games with personality and
artiﬁcial intelligence. They use the term “virtual human” to
describe a computer program that simulates a human in
some aspects.
With the ubiquity of AI applications, HCI research is
increasingly integrating these approaches, demonstrating that AI
and HCI are mutually beneﬁcial when they collaborate (
Panda
and Roy, 2024 ). However, criticism and bad experiences have also
been reported. For example, Choudhuri et al. (2024) state that
there were no statistical diﬀerences in participants’ productivity
or self-eﬃcacy when using ChatGPT compared to traditional
resources. Instead, they found signiﬁcantly higher frustration
levels, identifying ﬁve distinct errors resulting from violations of
human-AI interaction guidelines, leading to various (negative)
consequences for the participants.
LLMs are increasingly being used in studies to investigate the
interaction between humans and artiﬁcial agents.
Borghoﬀ et al.
(2024b) explore human-artiﬁcial interaction with generative AIs
in a software engineering project course. In the same domain,
Nascimento et al. (2023) evaluates ChatGPT-generated code against
developer-generated code to determine which tasks are better
suited for engineers and which are better handled by AI. This
could lead to more eﬃcient interaction (e.g., AI as a tutor for SE
developers) and provide new insights into innovative AI strategies
that include the involvement of humans-in-the-loop to support
the tasks of software engineering.
Capitanelli and Mastrogiovanni
(2024) demonstrate that LLMs can play an important role in
planning actions in human-robot interactions.
Giudici et al. (2024) present and evaluate a method
for analyzing user reactions to AI using a live-streaming
platform where human streamers conduct interviews that
are transmitted to a specially developed GPT voice interface
using a crowd-based approach.
Kim and Im (2023) study the
attribution of human characteristics to artiﬁcial intelligence. They
developed a tool to measure how users form anthropomorphic
reactions to interactions with AI chatbots in a banking service
setting. For a survey of Artiﬁcial Emotional Intelligence
(AEI) for cooperative social human-machine interactions see
Ahmadi and Hammond (2023) .
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) ( Papillon et al.,
2023) are a special class of neural networks that use the
aforementioned message-passing paradigm to capture interactions
between entities (often represented as nodes in a graph). In
MPNNs, nodes in a graph communicate with their neighbors
through a series of message-passing steps. This interaction allows
the network to learn representations by aggregating information
from neighboring nodes; see also the R ABBIT use case in Section 6.
A formal model of the global activity of a system of agents
is provided by concurrent game structures , describing a situation
where agents act according to individual strategies by which to
select individual actions based on knowledge of the global state
of the system. Reasoning on the possible evolutions of such
systems leads to the deﬁnition of some variations of Alternating-
Time Temporal Logic (see e.g.,
Alur et al., 2002 ; Alechina
et al., 2017 ; Mogavero et al., 2017 ). In contrast, a logic that
incorporates spatial constraints on a par with temporal ones has
been recently proposed by
Bottoni et al. (2024) . In general, these
models abstract the actual mechanisms through which information
about states can be exchanged among agents and assume that
all agents act rationally regarding their strategies. The level of
non-determinism inherent to considering human agents would,
therefore, require some adaptation of these logics in the direction

of identifying classes of agents that can follow several strategies
at once.
Although beyond the scope of this paper, there exists a
humanistic perspective (
Knell and Rüther, 2024 ), as well as an
ethical dimension, to human-artiﬁcial interaction. For the latter,
the reader is referred to
Kumar and Choudhury (2023b) , Karlan
(2023) and Nieto (2024) . In some ways, “virtual superhuman” AI
technologies could undermine the value of human achievements
(
Schaap et al., 2024 ) or even may pose an existential threat ( Kumar
and Choudhury, 2023a ).
/eight.tnum Conclusion and future work
We have outlined a framework that systematically considers
how human and artiﬁcial agents interact within a networked
ecosystem. By articulating HCI not just as human-computer
interactions but as dynamic interactions among diﬀerent agents
within a ﬂexible, multi-agent system, we have highlighted
the potential for more complex and eﬀective interactions.
The application of our multi-agent model to two diﬀerent
use cases—satellite and swarm robotics, and Large Action
Models (LAMs)—has not only validated our theoretical
constructs, but also underscored the practical implications of
such interactions.
In the ﬁrst use case, we observed how a semi-centralized
system, enabled by a large language model, could improve decision-
making processes and adaptability through real-time data-driven
adjustments. This setup not only ensures eﬃciency, but also
preserves human oversight, which is critical for managing complex,
dynamic environments.
The second use case involving LAMs further highlighted
the potential of integrating advanced computational agents to
predict and shape human-computer interactions. Using neuro-
symbolic programming, the LAM framework demonstrated its
ability to reﬁne its operations based on continuous feedback
from human interactions, promoting an adaptive and responsive
HCI system.
We have thus established a foundational framework for
the design and analysis of HCI systems that views these
interactions as a complex interplay among multiple agents.
This approach allows us to better understand and harness the
collective capabilities of diﬀerent agents, thereby enhancing
the system’s adaptability and resilience. Importantly, this
perspective aligns with emerging technology paradigms that
foster a deep understanding and integration of human agents.
Indeed, our contribution can be seen as a systemic evolution
in design approaches, emphasizing the front-end to enhance
usability and eﬀectiveness. This contrasts with, but complements,
systemic approaches that prioritize the back-end for security and
robustness, as illustrated by
Salzano et al. (2023) . Together, these
perspectives synergistically improve the overall architecture of
HCI systems.
The integration of human and artiﬁcial agents also raises critical
ethical and regulatory considerations. Our framework’s layered
communication spaces–surface, observation, and computation–
provide inherent auditability through explicit transition logs and
token-based interaction traces, aligning with AI accountability
guidelines (
Floridi, 2019 ; EU, 2024 ). For high-stakes domains
such as healthcare or defense, this enables clear attribution of
decisions to human or AI agents, while preserving the ﬂuidity of
Centaurian collaboration. Future work will further formalize these
mechanisms to ensure compliance with emerging standards for
hybrid intelligence systems.
Ultimately, our study enriches the understanding of HCI
as a dynamic and evolving ﬁeld characterized by the complex
yet symbiotic relationships between humans and machines.
As we delve deeper into these interactions, the possibility of
transforming human-computer interactions into more seamless
and eﬀective experiences becomes increasingly tangible. This
promises a future in which the human and artiﬁcial dimensions
are not merely aligned but fully integrated in a balanced
and complementary manner. Such integration could pave the
way for a new era of collective and hybrid intelligence—
where humans and machines work closely together—potentially
the most signiﬁcant and immediate outcome of current rapid
technological advances.
Future research will focus on improving the adaptability of
MAS by addressing the challenge of dynamic team composition.
Standard Petri nets, with their static structure, have diﬃculty
accommodating scenarios where agents join or leave while
maintaining consensus, as illustrated by the register and
deregister (for active agents) pseudo-code in Section 4.
Therefore, we plan to model agents as individual (colored) Petri
nets with specialized input and output locations, allowing token-
based message passing for seamless registration and deregistration.
However, smooth coordination requires high-level reconﬁguration
mechanisms to dynamically manage agent lifecycles. While these
improvements enhance the adaptability of MAS, Centaurian
systems, with their stable human-AI integration, remain well-
suited to Petri net formalization due to their reliance on ﬁxed
coordination structures.
Another important future research direction is the
development of a hybrid approach that bridges MAS and
Centaurian systems. While Petri nets eﬀectively model structured
Centaurian intelligence, where human and AI components
collaborate through predeﬁned coordination rules, they fall short
in dynamic MAS scenarios that require self-organization. Future
research will therefore integrate high-level reconﬁgurable networks
to enable agent ﬂuidity, while using communication spaces as an
intermediate layer for seamless coordination between autonomous
and tightly coupled agents. This three-tiered approach will enable
dynamic transitions between structured Centaurian intelligence
and decentralized MAS interactions. Given the increasing
importance of Centaurian AI in human-computer collaboration,
this hybrid framework will improve eﬃciency, adaptability,
and interoperability.
An alternative set-theoretic approach abstracts agent
relationships without rigid network structures, deﬁning
interactions through set membership and relational mappings.
While this circumvents the limitations of Petri nets in dynamic
scenarios, its implementation requires structured protocols
for message ﬂow and consistency. Our future research will
therefore explore how set-theoretic models can complement Petri
